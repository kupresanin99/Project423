## Project Charter 

**Vision**:  
To take it to the man.  In other words, for gambling purposes, help users consistently beat the MLB over / under runs totals wagers.  

**Mission**:  
Each day, the user can pull the runs total predictions for the slate of MLB games.  
These predictions can be used to make educated bets.

**Success criteria**:  

**Statistical Criteria**:  
Mean square error  
(model will produce a numerical prediction, "Total Runs Scored" for each MLB game today)  
(Hope to keep this under 1 run, but not sure at this point).  

**Business Criteria**:  
To win at sports gambling, the bettor needs to win more than 55 percent of wagers placed.  
From deployment through the end of the 2019 MLB regular season, I will use the model and track a running total of wagers won.
